The difference of parallelism and concurrency is as simply as defining what tasks would you do for preparing to watch your desired football matches on TV.
Parallelism occurs when you decide to boil the water for making coffee and noodles. Your stove can boil it with different pans.
Concurrency occurs when you cook your instant noodles as your meal for enhancing your enthusiasm to keep your eyes focus on watching football. While the stove boils the water, you can pour the seasonings first.
